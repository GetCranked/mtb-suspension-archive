# Shock DYNO action at FOX Service Center iberia (Bicimax) - MTB suspension Ep.18

Hi guys!
Today we have a very different video.
I'm going to the Fox Service Center Iberia and I'm going to show you
the inside of the service center and
also we are going to see the the shock dyno!
So stay tuned and come with me!
Hey Ricardo how are you?
Hi André! Welcome to our service center.
Ricardo, tell me what are you going to
show us today?
Today we are going to show you our service center and the electronic Dyno.
OK, great! So let's go.
OK André, we are in the core of
our service center and we have eight work benches
So we are prepared to have here 8
technicians full-time but at this moment
we have six technicians.
So here is one of our work bench
All the work benches are prepared for each technician to develop his work without disturbing other technicians.
All of them have the computer with our service center program that help us in the service procedure
So Ricardo, tell me... Are these from customers?
Well, yes! These are suspensions from our customers. They are stored here in this room waiting to be picked
by our technicians to do an evaluation and service them. So that's why they are here!
Are these brand new?? Can I take one with me?
Do you have money?
Hmmm... Five cents!
Oh my friend.....
So, tell me... what are these?
These are brand new Forks and
they are in our warehouse and they are
waiting to be sent to our customers.
Okay André, we are in our training room, and here we give special trainings to the local bike shops
Yes. I actually know this room already
because Fox invited me last year to
give a full day training about kinematics and suspension theory.
The room was full on that day and it was a great experience for me.
I hope you liked the training!
Yes André! We were pleased to receive you here last year and it was amazing to receive your technical inputs
OK Ricardo! Thank you.
So... enough talking for now
Can you show us the Dyno?
Yeah lets go!
So this is our electronic Dyno and what
this machine does is to compress and
extend the shock and it records the force that the hydraulic is doing
during this cycle of compression and extension
OK. So, with this machine we can see for instance the force that damper does at low speeds which is
basically the pedal bob and the rider induced movements and small bumps
and smooth transitions, and then you can
also see how the shock performs during
fast square-edged bumps, fast impacts or hard landings. Correct?
Correct! And we can also change the internal setting in order to fit the shock for the need of the rider.
So, you are telling me that if the rider wants a custom tune for his shock you can tune it
and then test in the machine to see how the custom tune changes the performance of the shock. Correct?
Yes, it's correct. We use
the Dyno to prove that our
tuning is producing the effects that we want.
Ricardo, this seems pretty interesting
to me.
Do you have curves recorded in this
computer?
Yes of course!
So, you have to send me some of these curves
to analyze in deep detail in future videos.
Of course! We will do that.
Yeah! We have new
content for next videos!
What you are seeing right now is
actually a real example of a Fox float DPS
and this shock actually belongs to
the MTB legend Tommi Misser (Orbea ambassador)
This type of graph represents the force that
the damper does across different shaft speeds
In the upper part of the graph (at blue)
you have the compression motion,
while in the bottom part of the graph (at red)
you have the rebound motion.
Moreover in the left part
of the graph you have the force that
damper does at slow speeds, while in the
right part of the graph you get the
force that the damper does at high
speeds. For instance fast compression
movements or fast extension or rebound
movements
So, Tomi requested Bicimax a custom tune
in order to get a more degressive damping.
The technicians at the Fox service center
changed the piston and valving
and now you have a much more digressive
curve on the compression phase.
Comparing both curves (the stock curve and the
modified curve) you can see that
with the custom tune the shock is much more
digressive, meaning that at low speed compressions
the shock will be quite stiff,
while at higher speed compressions
the shock actually is quite smooth.
Overall, this shock will be quite good for pedaling because it offers a lot of resistance against the
pedal bob, while when you hit for
instance a square edge bump like a rock
or a root, the shock opens the compression circuit
and absorbs quite well that kind of impacts
Thank you Ricardo! This was a great opportunity to see the service center
and I hope you liked this video!
So guys, see you next time! Byeee...
