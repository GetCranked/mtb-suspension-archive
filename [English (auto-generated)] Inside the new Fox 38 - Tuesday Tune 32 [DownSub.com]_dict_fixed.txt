hey guys Steve here from Boston on
suspension up in Whistler here with
another Tuesday tune this week to talk
about Fox's new fork to the 38
this is Fox's first all-new fourth
platform for quite a while since 2012
when they launched 34 Fox now have 32 34
36 38 and 40 I'm just going to assume
that you guys are all familiar with the
fact that the nomenclature refers to the
stanchion diameter in millimeters hence
the name 38 amazingly imaginative but at
least it lets you know where it stands
in their lineup so first things first
gonna look at the machete in the
structure of the fork then we'll dive
into the air spring and the damper so we
have have CSU here got the damper and
answering Whirlpool Park we have our
lower legs there's a few new features
that we haven't found in Fox force
before first of all obviously 38
normative stanchions this particular
fall also uses very interesting yeah
this is a very interesting open relief
in the steerer tube which means they can
make it thicker at the front of the back
where it needs to be thicker because
that's the part that really sees the
bending load and reduced some of the
white on the sides
things like this are really not easy to
make they do add quite a bit of they do
add quite a bit of expense and time to
the manufacturing what you can probably
also see may be a little bit hard to see
on camera this one isn't actually
perfectly clocked with the crown that's
not not a big deal I don't think but you
know if you're gonna go to the extent of
making something that that perfect and
that optimized I would have thought you
know a tool to align that really precise
as we've been pretty easy to make so
looking at this structure here we've got
two 38 millimeter stanchions we have one
thirty nine point eight millimeter OD
steerer tube here when we're bending
this we're trying to bend the whole
thing up like that this is really the
focal point of all load partly because
it also has a headset race sitting here
it's levering against alright so this is
really the weak link I don't personally
really see a huge benefit to stiffening
things in such an inefficient way that
we're using
a millimeter OD stanchions and you know
larger diameter lowers for great
offending stiffness when we still have
this weak point up here right and so it
really begs the question especially
given that we have forty six millimeter
of depth here and so obviously the craft
the statute doesn't go in quite all the
way that there's a couple mil left over
and we only have twenty five millimeters
here so we have you know we're getting
close to double the insertion here and
to the snatches and then we're just
running one Stuart Juvia I hate to be
the person to request a new standards
but this no longer makes sense this you
know if we're gonna go for these long
travel single crowns this really should
be a much larger diameter this needs to
be deeper insertion unfortunately that
would also mean that would also mean
longer axial crown lengths however I
believe that the reason that things have
been done the way that I have is
primarily not for stiffness concerns
because the thirty six is a an
adequately stiff fork for nearly all use
but probably again I speak without
insight into why Fox made these
decisions I'm speculating but probably
to address the concerns that people have
had with CSU's creaking over the years
having a stiffer interface here again
with the the thicker wall from the rear
will that should reduce the relative
motion which is the the fretting and the
creaking that we here between the
steerer tube and the crown it does sort
of beg the question like why the why the
thirty eight millimeter stuff at all the
answer might be the answer might lie in
the air spring and the necessity of
having a certain minimum inner diameter
to achieve what is achievable with this
particular type of air spring
next thing that might also be a little
bit hard to see on camera I'm hoping we
can kind of see it in there is the fact
that these stanchions are at least
double butted that is very high degree
of structural optimization maybe you can
see it bit better in there it means that
we can cut out weight and maintain
different strength again not super super
easy to do that is made possible in part
by the fact that we're now using this
inner tube assembly instead of the
extension instead of using the stanchion
as the tube for the ass ring so this
inner tube here sits this inner tube
here sits inside the other side
stanchion and this plunger goes inside
the inner tube this ridge that we have
here is basically where the equalization
port is that allows air to equalize
between positive and negative chambers
but we will go deeper into that in a
minute so let's have a look at the laws
so these lowers here I've pulled the
affirming out on one side so we can see
you soon as a channel after the inside
of that that goes behind the bushings
this is the most interesting feature of
these lowers to me because that allows
oil to get from where it sits you know
where gravity pulls it to sit down the
bottom up behind the back of that lower
bushing and up behind the back of the
upper bushing there to where the foam
ring is so that means that in theory by
tipping the the lowers up like that that
we can get the oil to come up and
lubricate the phone rings now we see
that in both ways we also have these air
release buttons for our people riding
bikes you know stratospheric elevations
I think they're a bit overkill
personally but I think there's also a
few people out there who will appreciate
what you will notice as well with these
lowers we have a solid upper bushing
meaning no slots and a slotted lower
bushing this a little bit hard to see at
the camera there I realize the slotted
lower bushing I think is a bit silly
that should also be a solid bushing
because that way you don't have the
abrupt changes in contact stress where
the slots are and if you have a look at
where stanchions start to wear out on
anything that uses slotted bushings
which means any Fox fork since 2002
and almost any Fox for since 2002 and
most rocks for since about 2013-2014
then we see that where the stanchions
start to wear out like where we start
sort of seeing vertical lines on them
indicating on the stanchion here this
attention obviously has nowhere it's a
brand new fork but we will will see
these vertical lines start to appear
right at the edge of where the the
slaughter and that is indicative that
obviously where there is a sudden drop
in contact stress because there is no
contact where the slots are that you
also have a higher local stress higher
local pressure that causes more wear
locally so I think those slotted
bushings idea is that they allow
lubricant to get up to the other side of
the bushing I think it also allows a
path for lubricant to avoid being on the
bearing surface which it can't do with
the solid bushings like that but it also
means that you have this uneven contact
pressure which leads to further wear
Rock trucks Forks typically for example
didn't have statue wear issues very
commonly before about 2013 or 2014
whenever the pike was first introduced
and started using a lot of bushings its
previously that new solid bushings in
there they were quite good so I think
that that's something that in my opinion
has sucked for nearly 20 years and you
know it doesn't it just doesn't need to
be slaughtered anymore there's no good
cause for those bushings to be
slaughtered given that you already have
a channel up the back of them to the oil
to get past them
anyway that is my rant on the lowest
besides that they have done a great
degree of weight optimization on the
arch you can see that how thin and
hollowed-out that really is which is a
good thing because looking at it it
certainly wasn't done for aesthetics in
my opinion it looks kind of cheap but
I've got to take that if it if it works
better
they've relieved the bottoms of these as
well they're sort of like what they've
done with the step cast but not really
quite the same yeah again structurally
efficient good to see one last feature
of the law is that I nearly missed there
they have this very interesting insert
the axle here so if you under this pinch
bolt this insert can float and that
means that on the other side where it
butts up against the hub this can
take up the any with variations that we
have here and so it will size it
essential it'll size of the gap in the
for precisely to fit your hub so it
means you undo this once
put the axle in clamp that clamp
together with the hub hub butts up
against that side and locates relative
to the brake mounts this part here will
be pushed over and at that point you do
the this bolt up and then with a quick
release version you never need to undo
that again that's a pretty good system I
think it's like a combination of the QR
15 system that we used for years and the
floating axles system that they had on
the older 36 and 40s pretty clean pretty
simple no complaints there let's have a
look at the air stream so the air spring
is probably the most interesting part of
the whole fork in my opinion so this
tube like I said slides up the inside of
the stanchion this air spring piston
sits on the inside of it
the esperan piston has a slightly
negative larger negative chamber this is
like the top hat same size as the thirty
Six's have and you can see where that
would sit bumper relative to the piston
so that's a good thing for bump
compliance means it can run it a bit
high pressure and so forth the fact that
runs at a high pressure though in the
fact that we have about the same
stanchion length as the thirty-six means
that then some people are going to run
into the situation where particularly
long travels the thing would become too
progressive and so this is why we have
this is i'm gonna speculate here because
i'm not privy to exactly why they've
done things I don't work for false but I
would suggest that this is why they have
done it things where they have with this
inner tube system so what that means is
they can use a smaller diameter piston
and because the piston diameter is
smaller the the volume that we have at
the top of the statute is
proportionately larger so it's like it's
the equivalent of taking your old
stanchion there's swelling on the top of
it to make it a larger volume air
chamber so that drops the compression
ratio because we've also reduced the
expansion ratio of the negative chamber
so I think this would be a very good
thing for bump compliance for support in
the middle
and also for allowing people to actually
effectively use the full traffic a big
part of the problem that we saw with the
36 I'm gonna say big pileup on I'm gonna
put this in context the 36 does not have
a big problem in that regard but it is
something that definitely needed some
improvement and it seems that Fox
affirmed recognize this identified it
correctly and worked on it so what I've
done to do that is that they've made the
aspect of the ramp-up that comes from
the lower legs so that where we have
essentially you know the bottom of the
stanchion sealed off and not being
compressed in the lowers so our homeland
camera here we have you know the bottom
of the lowers moving up to the bottom of
the stanchion the air that's compressed
in there generates a certain amount of
force and that is pretty significant so
if you're a particularly the lightweight
writer that doesn't work super well for
you because there's no way to scale it
whereas with the main part of the air
spring if you have double the pressure
you'll have double spring rate coming
from that part with the air in the
lowers it doesn't matter what pressure
you said your air spurring - that part's
the same whether you're you know 100
kilo right or a 50 kilo rider server you
have the same element of ramped up
coming from the lowers no matter who you
are that aspect wasn't great Fox has now
got this interesting cross drilled seal
head so which means that the seal
actually doesn't do this owing isn't a
seal it's just an o-ring which I suspect
is there to allow some side-to-side
movement and also prevent it from
rattling anyway these these cross holes
mean that the gap that we have between
the stanchion and this tube is
essentially part of the volume of the
lower legs and this is why we have the
o-rings up here sealing this - here
we've got air up here that's you know
part of the pressurized air spring and
everything outside of this is
communicable with the lower legs so that
means oil and yeah obviously we don't
really want oil up there because there's
nothing there's no moving parts between
here and there stanchion but any air
volume up there will help reduce the
rate of ramp up that is coming from the
lowers and in 180ml Fork
that's
really beneficial and so Fox did mention
this in their marketing spiel that's
something that I think is very positive
and a very good thing yeah in theory
this tube should have a certain amount
of play within the stanchion as well
right it's got a certain amount of
clearance to get in there and that means
that it will be allowed it will be able
to tolerate a certain degree of side
loading you know in theoretically more
than the different a different form
would have as for why there are two
earrings up here this seems to come from
the department of redundancy department
but I don't I don't presume that they
would have put it in there without a
good reason
there's probably some reason like
sideloading actually caused one to burp
and having to was in that having to in
there was enough to make it seal or
something along those lines I'm not a
hundred percent certain
I don't assume that they've done it from
no reason I don't know what the reason
is so now let's have a look at the way
that this damper is constructed now I've
already run this on the darkness already
know what the results kind of are now
this this rebound adjuster assembly here
we have a high speed rebound and low
speed rebound adjustment the low-speed
rebound assisted needle orifice system
as per normal the high speed is this
color here which rotates if you can see
that little spiral machined into that
color there then this leaf spring that
we have here by rotating that around you
change the amount of leverage that this
has over the leaf spring and so as the
leaf spring is engaged closer and closer
to the center the less the less leverage
that the oil essentially has to PUSH the
shims open the shims PUSH on this color
and the color then pushes on the the
leaf spring and so because the color has
less leverage over the leaf spring the
total mechanical advantage is greater
and that means it is effectively stiffer
it's very very similar it's not quite
identical but it is actually it's so
similar that it might as well be
revolving the rebound
on the dyno this works really really
well there is a very wide range however
the low-speed bleed on the rebound
adjusters in these is so large that most
bit is still the dominant effect on the
low-speed adjust as a huge impact on the
high-speed damping we'll see that I'll
show you the dyno curves in a little bit
so the next thing and where this damper
really varies more significantly well
you know at all I guess from the
previous generation grip to is this
compression or high-speed compression
adjust system here so this is the same
as what we've seen on the rebound piston
is formatted very slightly differently
because it's compression but you can see
here so there's a shim in there and then
there's this collar this collar you know
you can see there's not taking much
force this is my finger operated wire my
fingernail taking very little force to
move that so there is one shim in there
and then this collar which has again
that machined spiral on it that machine
spiral is really what is intended to do
the magic and so that means again that
we can vary the actual bending stiffness
of the whole system in a st. in the same
way that Reve Alvin the shim stack
actually does beyond that the dynamic
bleed aspect of this is the same as it
was before that function hasn't changed
you can see in here there is just in
there there is still that bleed port
that purges out excess or oil of things
over compressed or overfill they do
deliberately suck in oil from the lowers
via the u cup seal that they're having a
sealant so that acts as kind of a
one-way seal or seals oil very well
against pressure so pressuring the
damper cartridge and doesn't actually do
much at all to scrape oil off the shaft
here and so it's constantly ingesting
and that's why we have to run the same
well in the lower legs as we do the dam
for tube with these particular dampers
so go back to the compression this one
only has about seven clicks of high
speed compression from memory 16 or so
of low speed compression let's go and
have a look at what the depth of what
the doneness is so here is comparison of
the range of the 20 21 and 20 20
versions of the grip to compression
assembly you know we have up here is the
maximum compression damping that we can
get out of the 20 20 so we're looking at
about four hundred and forty four
hundred and fifty Newton's at one meter
a second at half a meter a second we're
looking at that two hundred and seventy
and yeah you can see quite clearly the
curve that this other gray line down the
bottom is the minimum that you can get
out of the the 2020 damper now the
really concerning / interesting thing is
this blue line here represents the 2021
damper and the maximum level of
compression that we can get out of it
the 2021 damper can only generate less
than a quarter unless so we have eighty
Newtons here and 450 here minutes it's
almost it's almost a fifth of the
compression damping that's available at
that speed which in one meter a second
is reasonably it's reasonably high speed
it's not a crazy high speed but it well
into the high speed region of the forks
movement why is it that we're one of the
years here we decided that the for
needed to have four times as much
damping as the other was it because this
is you know an approximately reasonable
amount and this is ridiculously low
which is my opinion actually or is that
that this is an approximately correct
amount and this is ridiculously high I
do think this is higher than most people
need but from looking at damper curves
for though for products that we've
developed and also ones that other
companies have developed
after market damper tuning options which
have had Dino curves
published it's actually not unrealistic
at all like this sort of level of force
so that's not a completely unusable
amount of compression damage now I have
to kind of put it out there that you
can't claim that this is a refined
product when we're still debating the
orders of magnitude which damping should
be on we can't say hey you know we moved
it a bit we've made things a bit better
right awaits to very you know the actual
demands do vary both of those are quite
writable interestingly which isn't
necessarily the case with other vehicles
but when you know the range is less than
a quarter of what it used to be and the
compression adjusters you know again
comparing here these two curves when the
compression adjusters are doing almost
nothing at the higher speeds then you
know all the technology that's gone into
all the technology that's gone into this
BBC stuff and the development time and
the effort and the money in the expense
of it is wasted
you know the adjusters are ineffective
and the reason for that I believe is and
I haven't properly investigated this yet
the reason for that I believe it is the
actual tune spec for it the valving spec
is quite inadequate gonna also open up
an old RC for sorry an old RC 2 damper
here so now what we say on the same
curve is this this was our old RC 2
damper at maximum low-speed and
high-speed damping and so that was still
significantly lower than the grip 2
which is I think why people yeah the
first gen gripped who was so supportive
because if you actually ran any
significant amount of compression
damping there was a lot available this
was not even a particularly firm damper
tune that was too soft for particularly
aggressive riders this was you know the
stock valving that they came with but
even that we're seeing is you know
roughly triple particularly at the very
low speeds this is significantly greater
then then what's available in this 2021
update and unfortunately I'm pretty
disappointed it does make me wonder
however this incredibly light
compression happening if it is something
to do with the tolerance stack
sensitivity of this design inherently so
if you change the stack height of any
part in here and there's quite a few
parts in stack that means kind of
essentially in series if you change the
dimensions of any of them significantly
at all then it's going to affect the
amount of either preload or float that
this spring here has these have quite
large ports so the larger the port the
greater the sensitivity to preload and
and float in particular because the
openings are very very small you know
you don't actually need a very
significant valve lift as it were shim
lifts in order for that to open and
allow a significant amount of flow and
so that the evidence for that comes from
the evidence from that without even
quantifying it comes from simply looking
at how far the rebound check valve opens
on here you know with smaller ports in
compression with very little force
available very little pressure available
to actually PUSH it back this thing
who's not generating a significant
amount of back pressure and when I say
it's not developing a scene to view it
is developing a significant amount
because it's measurable there like if
you look at it it's not even enough to
overcome the seal friction fully so that
is you know able to open a very small
distance and allow considerable amount
of oil to flow in rebound and assuming
that's adequate no I I do 107 believe
that it is then you know you can see
that shim openings of something like
this pretty significant as well so
if we run that fully stiff and even
fully stiff you can see still that I can
move that a Sumerian distance with
pretty minimal force from my thumbnail
so this this one needs some work so in
my opinion this is an interesting fork
in a lot of ways there's a lot of really
cool stuff in it the air spring is very
good it is quite heavy it is about a
pound heavier than a lyric I believe
maybe a pike at about 24 30 grams that
is the most by chemistry thing I've ever
said mixing pounds and grams it's round
about 430 grams heavier than so I think
it was a lyric might have been a pike
that I'm thinking of but anyway it's
pretty portly for once we get once we
get past the softness of the compression
damping then I think we are really
potentially onto something very special
like I said nothing to feeling criticism
everything can be improved this Fork is
definitely not perfect but it is also
definitely an improvement in some
regards and it's clear that Fox have
seen limitations of the 36 in particular
taking that on board identify the cause
and then you know taking steps to
improve it and so that's really you know
that's encouraging to see you do expect
no less
anyway that is it more than enough
rambling for me for this episode might
be another might be a little while
before you make another episode but
until then see you then
