good morning my name's Steve welcome to
the tube station we are here in the war
sprung workshop in Whistler and this
week we are gonna have a bit of a dig
inside the Rock shops Monarch plus and
the rush off super deluxe air the major
difference in terms of application is
that the monarch class it's the older
Imperial sizes and super deluxe fits the
new metric sizes so let's have a quick
look at those and see what we find
so here we have monarch class has
rebounded duster here obviously air
sprung and a three-position
compression adjuster on surface the
super deluxe that we have here is pretty
similar three-position compression
adjuster the rebound adjuster is in a
very different position as you can see
here the equivalent sizes between these
two would be 230 by 65 and a 216 by 63
here so this only has two millimeters
more stroke but it's 15 millimeters
longer so the idea with the metric
spacing is that it gives the designers a
lot more space to work with means that
they can have a bit more overlap in the
structure of the shock make it stiffer
you know more resistant to bending loads
also give a bit more space to physically
fit in all the features that they want
to fit in
okay so side-by-side with the monarch
class on the left here and super blocks
on the right we can see a couple of
obvious differences
first of all monarch class has a
two-piece air sleeve here so this is the
debonair sleeve has separations for the
positive chamber and the negative
chamber you can see the equalization
dimples in here Super Deluxe has one
piece air sleeve so they've enlarged the
negative chamber by bolting this out a
little bit you can see the equalization
dimple in there and now inside the air
can on super locks we have this
countermeasure spring which is coil
spring which is intended to counter the
pressure that's generated in the
reservoir by the IFP I'm not a massive
fan of this I think it's a bit of a
gimmick it doesn't really need to be
there
but you know if it's marketable and it
sells and whatever and it doesn't get in
the way massively then okay so let's
have a quick look inside the damping
circuits of the monarch classier so this
is monarch class bass valve so it's
pretty simple three position adjuster so
what is happening in this bass valve
when we flip the lever is that it's got
a little cam under the lever here so
when we flip this lever here it's
basically is it pushing this needle down
in the middle so in the fully open mode
here this allows quite a lot of oil
through the center of the bass valve
there as you can see so when we put it
into the trail mode there's little
plastic pushing I don't know if we can
really quite see it and add a little
white pushing this needle engages into
that and then oil can flow through this
tiny little hole inside and out at the
end this is very small bleed hole here
so that's your you know mid firmness
mode when it's put into the fully firm
mode this needle gets engaged into that
plastic Bush beyond that little hole
there and that means that no oil can
flow through the center of this all the
oil has to then flow through these
little entry windows here and those lead
to ports which come out under this huge
stack here so that will peel up this
preload assumes that now you can kind of
see the dish and shim stack there so
these shims are quite heavily pre-loaded
and that's your that's your climb mode
you'll lockout there are a couple of
limitations with this first of all the
open mode is extremely open virtually
nothing will ever flow through the the
shim stack except possibly at extremely
extremely high speeds the reason for
that is that Lamar here has a 10
millimeter shaft which is quite small it
doesn't displace a huge amount of oil
second thing this o-ring here does not
actually need to be there so that is
there to presumably to prevent oil blow
by but this piston is clamped tight by
the inside of this reservoir here and
there's constant metal to metal contact
from two smooth surfaces whole way
around there so that pit that I ring is
kind of redundant we see in the
super-deluxe
there's no mooring it's the the same
kind of setup but yeah they just replace
that with the crush wing crush washer
which is uh makes a bit more sense yeah
that is that this on the return valve
oil comes through these twelve ports
here these little ones you can see
around the outside and it will lift up
this check valve shim under here so that
bends up allows oil back through now on
the rebound adjuster here we have this
little adjusting needle on the inside
here and that's basically blocking off a
flow path that comes in through here so
in compression oil is flowing up the
middle of this hole here as well as
through this main piston so in through
these little ingress ports here Bend the
compression shim stack open and fill the
chamber between the main piston and seal
head here and what's displaced by the
shaft goes through the center of the
shaft up through the center of this
other broad that's sealed against the
the top of the shaft as well as being
sealed against this little white
crushing here goes through the middle of
this port that comes out into the
reservoir now what prevents it from
getting into coming through here and
then back into the rebound chamber is
this little check valve here so this
does have fully checked compression
rebound behavior which means that the
rebound adjustment does not actually
affect the compression behavior
now this main piston here this one has
actually been revolved this is not stock
valve in it or stock rebound valving it
is preloaded it's very heavily
pre-loaded which means that the stock
rebound valving in the medium
configuration never actually opens so
you basically have a ported damper in
rebound if you're running the medium or
higher
rebound tune compression tune is quite
linear quite soft even in the firmest
configuration by contrast let's have a
quick look at what we have in here so
here we have slightly different shape
steel head as we can see we have this
little top hat thing here so this
basically prevents the thing prevents
the piston getting as close to seal how
to top out and means that there's more
overlap distance between the bushing and
seal head and this piston here which is
good it stiffens the thing out this was
unnecessary on a chicken on certain
bikes the monarch classes were not the
most robust thing out there in terms of
their ability to withstand side loads
certain frames that put a lot of side
load on them would cause you know air to
burp and whatnot and this has this check
valve here very conventional rebound
adjuster that comes straight up the
middle it is still using a similar you
know twin tube system in here that's
forcing oil in compression it's
displaced by the shaft down the center
of this tube and into the reservoir by
the base valve base valves a little bit
different without in a say the main
differences to note though we have a
half inch shaft instead of a 10 mil so
it's displacing more oil into the into
the reservoir by the base valve it's
able to generate higher damping forces
from the base valve with lower pressures
and on that note the wall thickness of
this is quarter mil thicker than the
wall thickness on the monarch applause
now reason for that
multiple reasons they can get more seal
squeeze using the same size s leave
seals it stiffens the body here as well
which is also important because if you
try to get a ton of pressure out of the
base valve you can actually get enough
expansion of that body on the monarch
class that you get pissed and blow by
now interestingly these things to
actually use the same piston this piston
here is the same in the super-deluxe as
it is in my class disappointingly this
still has a pre-loaded rebound stack I'm
not really sure exactly why they persist
with these but they do does have a
linear compression stack though and the
rebound adjuster system is much better
it's also completely checked there is
absolutely zero flow through the rebound
adjuster impression which is you know at
least theoretically a benefit if not you
know in practice the air volume spaces
are a bit different in this so they have
a system more like what Fox have been
using for years with the space of
clipping and around the eyelet as
compared to the bands that would go
around
yeah Han on monarch class also have a
polymer IFP tapped and threaded the
cetyl RFP interesting tapping threads
into plastic but I suppose it should not
really be under much pressure now these
old metal life Peas this one is actually
pretty much pretty good condition but
you can see some wear marks around there
and it's very common for that to wear
right through the anodizing eventually
that eats the reservoir is there we make
upgraded acetal life piece for these as
well prevent that issue let's have a bit
more of a look at the base valve here so
this super-deluxe has a spring-loaded
a little spool and this is pretty pretty
nicely machine this thing quite a fan
and so you can see here the profile of
that now this still has a similar type
of plastic sleeve enough for this to fit
into but it has interestingly we
basically now have three completely
separate circuits so in the open mode
this little gap here sits over the sits
over the little plastic bush and so oil
get around that and at the end when you
put it into the mid mode then PUSH that
in a bit further then it starts to block
off at this end but it allows the oil
out through this piston here so this
piston here has a shim valve on it in
firms mode it only allows oil through
the preloaded shim stack you can see
this is fairly thick shim stack that's
got a fair amount of preload on it on
this main piston that means you can have
a firm climb mode but still actually
have a shimmed
valve the rest of the time now the open
variant of that is still quite open so
mathematically there are a couple of
substantial differences between these
two so the ten mil shaft on the monarch
class only has 62 percent of the
cross-sectional area and therefore the
oil displacement of the suitable locks
that means that it's harder for the base
valve to be effective and it has to
generate more pressure to generate the
same force so the base valve eni's is
not able to do as much as easily and the
design on the monarch class out of the
box is a little bit crude super-luxe has
definitely taken it up a notch there
so with super-luxe they've made it
possible to get a bit more damping from
the base valve without requiring crazy
high pressures
they'll stiffen the body to prevent the
elasticity of the body being an issue
there and give it more seal squeeze
and you can see due to that higher oil
displacement we have a larger reservoir
on the super-deluxe
then on the monarch plus so it's a
larger diameter used to account for more
oil flow so it's pretty interesting to
see the evolution from one shop to
another I mean obviously the
super-deluxe is physically much larger
shops bit heavier as well but you know
you can see why they've gone about
things the way that they have as well
one of the things that's quite
interesting about these two shops is
that you never be able to compare them
back-to-back because they're not made in
the same sizes there were some pretty
funny reviews getting around when the
super-deluxe first came out touting its
superiority and saying you know a metric
is so much better when in reality that
there are confounding factors that are
quite substantial different leverage
rates for example a lot of these shops
were tested back-to-back on the
transition patrol but when the upper
link was changed so is the leverage rate
they became more progressive and that
means you inherently have a softer
initial stroke and a firm answer so a
lot of those comparisons were
realistically pretty bogus anyway hope
you guys found that somewhat interesting
informative and it really leads to a
deeper insight of what's inside these
shocks and how they had the to compare
and you know how the design process has
evolved for those two anyway till next
week I'll see you then
